A small 3D vertical-tower runner built in **Unity** and shipped as a **WebGL** app via **Netlify**. The front end is a **React + TypeScript + Vite** web app. Game Jam style development cycle (developed over the span of 48 hours).

Programmed, modelled, and animated by **Bradley Morrison**.

> TL;DR ðŸ™‚: Run up tower. Dodge the gaps. Collect coins & tokens. Win = collect Gem. Donâ€™t fall. (You will.)
